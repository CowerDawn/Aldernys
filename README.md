The file manager for AMNY Project. 
The open source and multi platform program for Linux, BSD and macOS. AMNY Project - Multiplatform project with a package of programs for specific tasks. There is a program for any task!: Office, gaming, programming and home use! All programs are tested on GNU/Linux and may be unstable on other OS or not run at all. All programs are made in an intuitive design that even a child can understand. Some programs from this homebrew package may only be made for Arch Linux. Also on Wayland or something similar many programs from AMNY may not work. Almost all programs were made on the QT framework. Because of this, the programs are most compatible with KDE or other DE written on QT. Some programs were inspired by the programs of the KDE project, especially with the old design. Also for programs it is recommended to use the axugen icon pack for a full understanding of the programs from this package 
Many programs from the AMNY package will be located on this GitHub: https://github.com/CowerDawn

# History:
Initially there was STFM - a file manager in Python, which was for the terminal. For STFM, SGFM was created - a version with a poor interface and large bugs, to fix all the errors and improve the interface, a fork was created called FK-Files.It was much better than SGFM in everything, but it still had bugs and an ugly interface. Having understood all the mistakes, Aldernys was created, which is already much better than its predecessors. The Aldernys project is still developing, before the first beta version is released, Altuis will be created - a file manager in C inside the terminal. It is already in development.
